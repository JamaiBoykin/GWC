        <p>Hey there ! My name is Jamai(Jah-May). I am currently 15 and going into my junior year at KIPP DC: College Preparatory. But, I will be turning 16 soon because my birthday is August 30th :) I play basketball and soccer. I also enjoy shopping and spending time with my family.
        <p><strong>Likes:</strong> Dancing, playing sports, eating, sleeping, going outside !
        <p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> Peas, heights, bugs, etc.

      <h3> Why I Care About Homelessness... </h3>
        <p>Homelessness is very important to me because seeing people outside sleeping under bridges, on the sidewalk, on benches in the park, & other things like that, it honestly bothers me. I feel as though I am very privileged and I believe that everybody should have that opportunity.
